<h1>Plane Your Vacation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the static hosting site for my android app, Plane Your Vacation. This is my Capstone project at WGU. The app is used to 
create and manage vacations and excursions, with features like inserting, updating, and deleting vacations and excursions from the SQLite Room database.
There is an encrypted login, search report feature, and scalable design features like RecyclerViews updating content from the database.</p>
